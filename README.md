# CSFundamentalAlgorithms

- CS: (C)omputer(S)cience, & (CS)harp. 

- Contains C# code for fundamental and basic algorithms and data structures in computer science. 

- When internally implemented methods exist for a desired functionality, they are not used in favor of implementing them from scratch.
