These versions of sort algorithms are for checking their stability. 
This means to check whether the sort algorithms preserve the original ordering of the duplicate elements in the original array after sorting them. 
To keep the main algorithms simple, these versions have their own folder and namespace. Otherwise the essense and logics of the algorithms is the same with the original versions. 
The only extra operation within the sort algorithms is updating the new versions. 

Stable sort methods: 
- MergeSort
- RadixSort
- InsertionSort
- BubbleSort


UnStable sort methods:
