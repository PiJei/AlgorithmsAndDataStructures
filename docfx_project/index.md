# Algorithms and Data Structures in C#
This repository includes a comprehensive collection of well-known fundamental algorithms and data structures of computer science implemented in C#. 

These algorithms and data structures are the basics behind *coding interview questions* and a deep understanding of their details is essential for passing these interviewes. 

- For a list of algorithms and data structures implemented in this repository see [Algorithms and Data Structures](articles/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures.md).
- To contribute follow [coding guidelines](articles/CodingGuidelines.md).
- To review code API see [API Documentation](api/CSFundamentals.Algorithms.GraphTraversal.yml).

## **Main Features**
- Algorithms are decorated with **time and space complexity** attributes. 

- For complex algorithms, for each unit test an **Images** folder is provided that shows the step by step execution of the algorithm.

- This repository is paired with a [**Udemy Course**](https://www.udemy.com/instructor/course/2378432/) that teaches all the algorithms and data structures implemented here with animated operations over the same examples demonstrated via this repository's unit tests, and images. 
    
- When applicable some algorithms have both **iterative and recursive** versions. 

- All methods are tested by **unit tests**. Other than checking the corecteness of the implementation, unit tests help to understand how to use each data structure and algorithm. 

- All the public methods have **summaries and detailed comments** to explain the over all functionality and the logic behind each complex line of code.  

- **Docfx** is used to automatically generate **API Documentation** as the code evolves. 



## **Disclaimer**
