# Fundamental Algorithms and Data Structures in C#
This repository includes a comprehensive collection of well-known fundamental algorithms and data structures of computer science implemented in C#. 

- For a list of algorithms and data structures implemented in this repository see [Algorithms and Data Structures](articles/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures.md).
- To contribute follow [coding guidelines](articles/CodingGuidelines.md).
- To review code API see [API Documentation](api/CSFundamentals.Algorithms.GraphTraversal.yml).

**Features**
- When applicable, algorithms and data structures are decorated with time and space complexity attributes. 
- For complex operations and algorithms, besides tests an **Images** folder is provided that shows the step by step execution of the algorithm. For example with a B-Tree insert operation as tested with a unit test is also accompanied by an image to show how the tree changes after each operation. 
- When applicable some algorithms have both iterative and recursive versions. 
- All the methods are accompanied by unit tests. 
- To understand how to use a data structure or an algorithm, navigate to the corresponding tests.
- Continuous integration (build and test) is enabled using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) tool.

**Disclaimer**
- The code is extensively tested, and is correct only to the best of the knowledge of the authors. Yet the authors take no responsibility in the correctness of the code. Please use at your own risk.
