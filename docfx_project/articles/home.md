This repository includes a comprehensive collection of well-known fundamental algorithms and data structures of computer science implemented in C#. 

- For a list of algorithms and data structures implemented in this repository see [Content page](https://github.com/PiJei/CSFundamentalAlgorithms/wiki/Content).
- When applicable, algorithms and data structures are decorated with time and space complexity attributes. 
- For complex operations and algorithms, besides tests an **Images** folder is provided that shows the step by step execution of the algorithm. For example with a B-Tree insert operation as tested with a unit test is also accompanied by an image to show how the tree changes after each operation. 
- When applicable some algorithms have both iterative and recursive versions. 
- All the methods are accompanied by unit tests. 
- To understand how to use a data structure or an algorithm, navigate to the corresponding tests.
- Continues integration (build and test) is enabled using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) tool.
